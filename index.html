          <h1>CAREER OBJECTIVE</h1>
          <p>
            As a NON computer science graduate, I realize I'm lack of computer
            science knowledge. However, I'm willing to learn by myself through
            the Internet and take some related courses while I was attending
            school. There are a lot of thing to catch up, but I will do my best
            to become a qualified web developer!

              Kidchen Club is the place where children can learn baking and
              cooking in English in a more dymatically way. In the beginning I
              worked as a teacher assistant in the Kidchen Club. <br />After one
              year, I start to teach at Kidchen Club as a teacher in English.
              Apart from cooking and baking class, during summer vacation, I
              also teached kids some courses about science and do experiments
              with them.<br />
              Though this job is not quite related to web development, I learned
              a lot about how to 'talk clearly enoungh' to be understood and how
              to express yourself in English and be confident in front of many
              people.

              I worked as a korean manga translator for about one year.
              Basically my job is translating korean into mandarin. This is a
              remote job so I can do my job anywhere with my computer.

              I worked as an UI intern in Shanghai far eastern It Co., Ltd. for
              about two months.
              <br />
              Interns are in charge of creating a simple Online bill paying
              systems using a Low-Code Development Platform called
              'outsystem'.<br />
              Basically I was in charge of designing the user interface and
              interaction on the screen(front end) while my friend was in charge
              of controlling the data flow underneeth the hood.(backend)
              <br />During the internship, I learned how to communicate with my
              teammates who did different job with me and I found it important
              to have a efficient and effective communication during the review
              meeting per week. Additionally, I also learn how to make an
              easy-to-read PPT and conclude what we had done every week in a
              nice way to our mentor.
